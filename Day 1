## Yo, I am Rashad West

 I learned what a Jupiter notebook today.  It was a journey but I am starting to figure it out.  You can run commands similar to the commands in the terminal.  It also hosts data.
 The google collab I am using has a better text editor, rich text, and the ability to create more graphical capabilities.    

We downloaded Pandas library.  I am excited because this is for the python language to deal with data and analytics.  I had to enter the Panda notebook through using the pd commands.  One of the lines we used was "import pandas as pd".
All of these command lines were given to me through a resource that had a bunch of information on the download.  It is interesting because not a bunch happens when you download it.
In collab if the command line works it doesnt do anything which is different than the terminal.  Once it was added then I was able to add data to collab and that got me excited!

Then you have to run commands to gt the data to show up in the text editor.  I learned that CSV files are generally faster and less complicated than XLS files.  

We added the data by going to file and uploading the CSV file.  We uses cat "("Chris_Mullen_88.csv")" to access our data. We then used the line "dataframe = pd.read_csv("Chris_Mullen_88.csv")" and then "dataframe" to put our data into a dataframe. 
A dataframe is a two column array like structure that contains values.  Some of the file types we used were binary, sql, and text.  I look forward to learning more.
