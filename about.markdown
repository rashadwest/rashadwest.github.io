I am Rashad West and I am creating a data science project to determine NBA player performance.  We are looking at a players best year and are trying to find out what happened in the following years for their perormance to decline.  This may be due to many factors including coaching, new players, players leaving, more games on television, etc.  I truly believe that their are factors that determine performance in team sports but often players do not realize that they are happening because they are so into the process and their development. 

I appreiciate you going on this journey with me and I think it will be fun. Below is some of my story.
