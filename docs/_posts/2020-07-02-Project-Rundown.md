## Yo, I am a post

Tell me all about your NBA project here. I know we added a few lines to the jupyter notebook today, can you tell me about what those lines do?

Here are a few of the other concepts we explored today:

- What is the Pandas library?
- What is a Jupyter Notebook?
- How do you importa the pandas library into a Jupyter notebook?
- How can we add data to a Jupyter notebook?
- How can we access the data we add to a Jupyter notebook?
- How can transform our data from it's file type into a dataframe?
- What is a dataframe?
- What are a few examples of different file types?
