I have started to learn about Google Collab and some commands in the system.  It has been great to learn new things in CS and get into data science.  
It has made me even see the possiblities of what I can do with the new skills I am learning.  While working with Alivia I thought about the NBA data. 
We were talking through what the determining factors were that make a player great.  I know for a fact there is not a bad player that has ever shot the ball well.

The 50-40-90 club is what I started to think of as we brainstormed.  It is a metric used for players that shoot at least 50% from 2point field goal range, 40% from 3 point range,
and 90% from the free throw line for an entire season.  This is a ver elite club.  There has only been 8 players that have done it in the history of the National Basketball Association. 
5 of the 8 players were NBA league MVPs. I think this metric will be essential for what we do in this project.  When I saw Chris Mullens stats I was very impressed with him. 
He shot 51%, 38%, and 87% for his career.  Although he shot the ball really well he never got into the 50-40-90 club.  

Another determining factor on rather you are a great player is points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks.  These are the main statistics for a game.  If a team dominates 
in multiple categories they normally win the game easily.  I am now thinking through how we can use the 50-40-90 metric to find out if a player has been efficient and effective.  
If Chris Mullen has steady games where he is shooting near these averages and then his performance goes down.  I would like to look at what could have made that happen.  

This should be fun!
