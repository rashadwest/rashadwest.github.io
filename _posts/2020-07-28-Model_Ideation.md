# Model Ideation 

## I am learning how to build models for problems 

Alivia asked me to figure out a way that we can figure out a better way to search for movies on Netflix 

The example she used was searching for "basketball analytics" and nothing came up.  I know there is at least one movie that is on the Netflix platform that deals with some type of basketball analytics. 

How do we create an algo that can find this when we search?

My idea is to create an algo similar to what Genius has.  The company Genius has a system where they capture all of the text for songs and books.  They then have individuals well versed in music or books 
that comment what the meaning of each line, bar, or lyric means.  

This could enable individuals to search for topics or anything they want and most things could turn out search results if they keep a large database of everything that is stored.

They could sor everything through a filtering system by subject matter and let the subject results with that particular word or phrase in it to be brought up first.
