# Model Ideation 

## I am learning how to build models for problems 

Alivia asked me to figure out a way that we can figure out a better way to search for movies on Netflix 

The example she used was searching for "basketball analytics" and nothing came up.  I know there is at least one movie that is on the Netflix platform that deals with some type of basketball analytics. 

How do we create an algo that can find this when we search?

My idea is to create an algo similar to what Genius has.  The company Genius has a system where they capture all of the text for songs and books.  They then have individuals well versed in music or books 
that comment on what the meaning of each line, bar, or lyric means.  

This could enable individuals to search for topics or anything they want and most things could turn out search results if they keep a large database of everything that is stored.

They could sort everything through a filtering system by subject matter and let the subject results with that particular word or phrase in it to be brought up first.

## How do you find the theme in a movie without the director or writer adding it?  What if I wanted all the movies that show hidden racism

ie. language, body language, or innuendos
- How can you filter racism into a search query? 
- Classism 
- Cultural events
- How do you create categories that are not popular?
- Sexism 
- Respect 
- Sneaker culture 

Value Systems with cultural relevance
- What if you are from the US but you like Nigerian culture (how can you find the movies you like)

Language 
- Natural language processing 

Visualizing a time period
- Time period pieces 

How could you classify a movie as positive or negative?
- The value system is what 

What is the movie trying to convey?
- How can a model pick up on this?
- How can a computer model reasoning and causality?
  - This has not happened yet

Creating a filter for racism

If you can define something in a way that no one else has to solve a problem you can help companies or people. 

Todos:
- Thinking about these examples and try to define them
= What would I need to do to prove out that something is true
