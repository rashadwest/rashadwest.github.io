As I struggled the first week to get the GitHub pages up I realized that I was doing things all wrong.  I will be aproccess of learning 
this approach below.

Read the instructions once in your head
Re-read the instructions aloud
Write down what is being asked of you in your own words
If you are reading documentaion about something unfamiliar jst to understand how it works, write down terms that you do not understand
