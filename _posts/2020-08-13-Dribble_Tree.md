# Dribble Tree

## Learn math through dribbling

Beat the Expert has been developed over the years to be a dynamic game.  It teaches math through playing basketball.  We teach arithmetic and algebra through our dribble system called the dribble tree.  
Our dribble tree consists of the five commonly known dribbles in basketball.  

- 1 = Pound, 2 = Crossover, 3 = In & Out, 4 = Between the legs, 5 = Behind the back.  

Within the dribble tree system, an individual has two dribble combos and three dribble combos.  When you combine a dribble, you are doing arithmetic.  If you put together 
1 + 2, then that equals 3.  If you then determine that you are going to 30, then now you are doing algebra.  So the equation would be x(1+2) = 30.  This is just one of the ways we teach math in our Beat the Expert game.
