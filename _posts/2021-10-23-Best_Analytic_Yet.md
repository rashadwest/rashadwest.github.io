#Best Analytic yet 

We have developed a Basketball GPS dribble plot.  This is the first of its kind that I know of.  It enables you to look at a plot and see what a player did and gather the data 
from what that player did all by looking at one place.  it makes it much easier to see the whole story of a possession or a season.  The player data is stored in levels of difficulty of 
each move as well.   This helps you to be able to see tendencies and proficiency.  

I will share more as weget closer to launching thius new algo.  This is the best thing we have developed to date in my opinion.  The dribble tree has been an important 
part of the development of this algorthim.

We will be sharing this algo by the end of the year.
