# Active Education 

## What we have created is dope! Period! 

The more and more I think about the human experience I think we are doing it all wrong.  We are built to explore, run, jump, socialize, and build.  Our new digital society
is built on sitting in front of a computer and that is what the majority of the "successful" people do.  This is crazy! The people who are active and doing stuff that we came on earth to do like the trades of the world are not really rewarded from a financial perspective.  Let's think about this for a second. 

I am a person who does not mind working.  I actually like hard work.  When something is boring it is boring.  The only thing fun about coding to be the way it is structured is when you figure out a bug or when you see a finished iteration or project.  Why shouldn't we have fun while learning?  Why shouldn't we wake up in the morning jumping up and down because we are ready to learn! 

We use basketball(sport) to teach.  Every time I tell people that they start to talk about music.  The majority of music is dope in it's own unique way but normally when you are doing music you are sitting there stagnant.  We have to stop sitting.  I think dancing, running, playing are the ways we should learn.  I think education should be active! 

Say what you want but I think if you showed the first human that was ever here what you are doing now.  They would tell you you are doing it all wrong.  I think we are.  Just think if you could activate code through a physical system where you are grabbing virtual objects and putting them into an environment.  Or maybe through playing a sport with your team where yall are all just doing what you are good at and executing on the project.  

Will everyone participate in this type of learning?  I am not sure.  There can be the way we are doing things right now as well.  I think there should be more active then inactive.  Soon we will be sitting at home and running our life as an avatar. 

There is nothing good about where we are going in my opinion.  I understand the only way to change the trajectory is to build systems in which people can see what I am saying. 

My friend Dr. John Drazan says it best in this speech he gave at MIT when he won the research paper competition. [MIT Presentation](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/content/sports-science-using-basketball-analytics-broaden-appeal-math-science-among-youth/)

The one thing I realize that in our society seeing is believing! Execute! Execute! Execute!
