# Active Education 

## What we have created is dope! Period! 

The more and more I think about the human experience I think we are doing it all wrong.  We are build to explore, run, jump, socialize, and build.  Our new digital society
is built on sitting in front of a computer and that is what the majority of the "successful" people do.  This is crazy! The people who are active and doing stuff that we came on earth to do 
like the trades of the world are not really rewarded from a financial perspective.  Let's think about this for a second. 

I am a person who does not mind working.  I actually like hard work.  When something is boring it is boring.  The only thing fun about coding to me the way it is structured is when you 
figure out a bug or when you see a finished iteration or project.  Why should'nt learning be fun!  Why shouldnt we wake up in the morning jumping up and down because we are 
ready to learn; literally. 

We use basketball(sport) to teach.  Everytime I tell people that they start to talk about music.  The majority of music is dope dont get me wrong but normally when you are doing music yuou are 
sitting there.  We have to stop sitting.  I think dancing, running, playing are the ways we should learn.  I think education should be active! 

Say what you want but I think if you showed the first human that was ever here what you are doing now.  They would tell you you are doing it all wrong.  I think we are.  Just think if you could activate 
code through a physical system where you are grabbing virtual objects and putting them into an environment.  Or maybe through playing a sport with your team where yall are all just doing what you are good 
at and executing on the project.  

Will everyone do it I do not think so.  There can be the way we are doing things right now as well.  I think there should be more active then inactive.  Soon we will be sitting at home and running our life as an avatar. 

There is nothing good about where we are going in my opinion.  I understand the only way to change the trajectory is to build systems in which people can see what I am saying. 

In our society seeing is beleving!
