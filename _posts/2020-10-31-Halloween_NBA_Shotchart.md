I started Halloween off by coding a new shot chart using NBA data. 

1. I went to Google Colab to start a new project 
2. I found a way to get the NBA data through there api
3. Accessed the data set for a player to make sure it works 

Here is what I have so far.  I have ran into problems trying to get Lebron James data but I will try some more tonight.

I have started to get more done with the shot chart but I hit a roadblock with the NameError message.  It seems that regardless of what code I get to run it will not print the variables I set.  I will look more into it and get back to you on my progress.
