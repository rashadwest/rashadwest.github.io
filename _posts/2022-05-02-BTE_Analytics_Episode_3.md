# BTE Analytics Episode 3 

I was doing VR applications before most people knew that the Metaverse ever would exist.  I will try to dive into what inspired me to get into this so early. 

I saw a need for teaching the game in an analytical way and I knew that without an immersive technology it was going to be hard to make this happen.  I started to think about the game
more like you see below. Where I knew everything needed to be quantitative but not how.  This is ultimatley the simpliest version I could come up with so people could understand my vision.  This was just the start.

While I was playing I was just trying to do what my job required at the best of my ability.  I never guested that I would ever chainge into an analyst after my playing days were over.  This guy never thought about XR.

Fast forward to today and I am thinking about the least explored part of XR which is AR.  It will change how we interact, communicate, and make money in the real world forever.  


I look forward to sharing with yall the progress soon.
