# BTE Analytics talk 

I am deciding to talk about analytics and what we are doing differently. I want to finish out this post with a video tomorrow talking about predictive analytics. 

I wanted to get into the mind of a coach or scout and I feel like this is the best way to do so.

In this article, you see what most gamblers look at when they are trying to make a bet on a team. Although this is not a direct science, I want to look at what helps a team win or lose. 

I think the aim is to score more points than your opponent. Tonight I saw a display put on where the Dallas Mavericks simply outscored the Suns.  

They did it in a way where they were up 30 points at halftime. This enabled them to keep the lead the entire game. Their top two scorers scored 21 and 27 points 

in the first half and the Sun’s top 3 scorers had 3 points combined.  

I realized that if a team knows how to stop a team’s top 3 performers, then maybe that is a way to win a key game. The game tonight ended with the Suns stars barely scoring 

in double figures and shooting a terrible percentage. 

I can not wait to tell you what I am thinking regarding this tomorrow.
