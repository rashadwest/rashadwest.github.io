# BallEd2 

I thought I would go into more detail on how we are doing some of this. If you look at the video below it explains everything. You have to have the dribble tree 
so I am living it here. 

We have two different types of games and each are done differently. 

1. We have a dribbling game. 
With the dribbling game you are doing a DribbleTree equation while stationary or moving while dribbling. 

So we gave this individual an equation x(2+4)=60 so they had to solve using basketball. 
This made the player pick a 42(between the legs, cross) as the dribbles he used to get the answer. 

2, We have a shooting game. 
With the shooting game you are using another equation to get to the answer. If you are using a 5 dribble for example like this player this is how you get the answner. 

BTE Dribble x BTE Value = BTE Score

The BallEd even goes deeper than this and goes into coding.
