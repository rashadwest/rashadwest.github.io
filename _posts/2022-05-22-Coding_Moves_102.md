# Coding moves 102


This is the famous Nike Commerical that came out in the early 200 where indivudals were dribbling to the beat. 

## BTE Trainer Coding Game

Game: How do you play? First, we have to teach you the rules. 
- BTE Sequence = BTE Combo X Number of times the combo was done 

- The BTE Dribble Score has three different ways of calculation that is dependent on if the combo is a one, two, or three dribble sequence
  - BTE Dribble Score = (BTE dribble#) X Number of times the combo was done
  - BTE Dribble Score = (BTE dribble# + BTE dribble#) X Number of times the combo was done
  - BTE Dribble Score = (BTE dribble# + BTE dribble# + BTE dribble#) X Number of times the combo was done

- BTE_Coding_Moves_Question
  - How many times does he do the BTE Combo 4 sequence and what is his BTE Dribble Score?

We only code the BTE Combo to get the BTE Dribble Score.  There are tradational dribbles, a full combo, and a BTE combo. 
- Dribbles = 1, 3, 2, 4
  - Every individual dribble 
- Full Combo = 1324
  - A combo of dribbles within the full sequence of a move
- BTE Combo = 324
  - The 3 core attacking dribble normally at the end of the sequence to create a move

After watching the dribbler this is what I entered as my first line of code.

Here are an example of each of the dribbles the dribbler did. 
- `4` Between the legs where the ball goes from one hand to the other with the ball landing between your legs exchanging hands
- `2` Crossover is when you exchange hands with the ball in front of your body 

## Coding Sequence

### Create a list

- This is what a list looks like. Adrian does 1 combo so we add that next into the brackets
- `Combo1 = []` 

### Put your value into the list

- 4(Between the legs) BTE combo 
- `Combo1 = [442]`

### Multiply the list to get the exact amout of times the trainer does the move

- He did the 442 BTE Combo 4 times so we multiplied the list times 4 to get our answer for the sequences 
- `Combo1 = [442]*4`

### Print the result 

- He did the dribble 4 times so the combo should be printed 7 times 
- `[442, 442, 442, 442)`

## Coding BTE Dribble Score

Here is the answer to coding Coach Adrians BTE Dribble Score below.

### Create a list

- This is what a list looks like. Adrian does 1 combo so we add that next into the brackets
- `Combo1 = []` 

### Put your value into the list

- He does a 3(In & Out dribble), 2(Crossover), 4(Between the legs) BTE combo 
- `Combo1 = [4+4+2]`

### Multiply the list to get the exact amout of times the trainer does the move

- He did the 324 BTE Combo 3 times perfectly so we multiply by that number
- `Combo1 = [4+4+2]*4`

## Print the result 

- He did the 442 dribble 3 times so the combo should be printed 4 times 
- `[10, 10, 10, 10)`

### Then you have to set everything to Combo1Total

- Now we are totaling up the score 
- `Combo1Total = Combo1 = [4+4+2]*4`
- `print(Combo1)`

## Last you add up the totals through using Combo1Total 

- You use the sum() method to total everything up
- `sum(Combo1Total)+4`
- You add the +4 because he had an additional dribble

This is his actual answer where he messes up at 4 so his score at 3. So his score is below.
