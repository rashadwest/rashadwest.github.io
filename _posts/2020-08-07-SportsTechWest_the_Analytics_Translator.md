## The problem I am solving 

There is a huge divide between the coach/trainer/player and the front office/data science department of a team or organization.  Insert Rashad West who is a 
former professional basketball player but now spends his time developing technology and analyzing performance.  

Ok, I am done talking about myself in 3rd person.  To be honest I am an individual who loves the nuances of basketball.  The game takes on many different styles 
and it can be played with so many different paces.  It is a true art form that the world is starting to appreciate.  

Just think about it like this.  You have multiple players who are great in the NBA.  However, there are 4 that have stood out for revolutionizing the game over the past decade. 

One of them is almost 7 foot tall silky smooth point forward that cannot lift 185 pounds once at the combine, one is a 6'8 260 pound freight train that moves like a ballerina and can see the court like he has xray vision, the other is 6'2ish 185 poundish point guard/shooting guard
that can shot from outside of the arena and handle the ball with the precision of an exacto knife, and the last is a guy who is 6'8 whose hands are bigger than both of your hands put together and you could not get around him in a gameshow of "glatiator" in the game [Pyriamid](https://youtu.be/x5_ivBV7FMo) if your
life depended on it. 

So this is why I love this game.  If you become skilled at a certain element you can become successful.  Dennis Rodman is an all time great in the game of basketball.  You would think sense the game is about scoring more points than your opponent that he was a great scorer.  Well you are wrong!  He was a tenacious defender and a relentless rebounder.  He would have games where he did
did not score a point but he still impacted the game in so many ways.  Things like this is now being measured in more ways than you could ever think.  Advanced metrics have taken the sports world by storm.  So much that some teams are using it to their compeitive advantage more than others.  This is 
because some teams do not know what is best for their circustance necessarily and their is sometimes a divide between the front office, coaches, trainers, and players.  This divide is not malicious it is just each department comes with it's own unique set of challenges. 

I believe that I can help.  I have a unique understanding of being a player and trainer at a high level and also the ability to decifer new technology and am now learning how to decode data sets and algorthims.  

It will be fun to talk to more teams and organizations about what I can bring to the table.  I want to find more players who could fit into a role like this one as a consultant or in an official role with a team. 

Analytics are taking over the game and if a team is as worried about success as I think they should be they should loading up on secret weapons that are players that understand the tech and data side of things!
