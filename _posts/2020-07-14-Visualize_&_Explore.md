# Visualize and Explore

Learning from the teacher!  I will put the definitions in my own words soon i just grabbed all the definitions. 

"What graphing tools are available?
There are a ton. If we were not data scientists and instead attempting to move into data analytics, tableu would be enough for us to visualize the data but we need more. We want to view trends and understand certain days when no data at all was collected. In oreder for us to do that we are going to explore a few libraries."

matplotlib
- Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+
ggplot
- ggplot2 is a data visualization package for the statistical programming language R. Created by Hadley Wickham in 2005, ggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson's Grammar of Graphicsâ€”a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers.
seaborn
- Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Lets start to visualize our data.
