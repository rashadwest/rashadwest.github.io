#New_Analytic

Beat the Expert is a game where we make youth basketball analytics educational in real time.  Here is a new analytic that describes the game in detail.
We are looking at the comparisons of Ja Morant and Terry Rozier.  If you look at the combinations of made shots between the two players they are simialar.  
They both do not over dribble and generally make 1 or 2 combo dribbles to get to the basket or to get to their shot.  

We are looking throughout the year at certain players to determine their efficiency with certain combo dribbles.  If you look at the comparison make sure you
know the dribble tree or it may seem confusing.  I have also included the dribble tree legend here.  I will continue to post about the progress of this vizualization. 
I am also working on a shot plot but their are a few bugs that I am working through at the moment in my jupiter notebook.
