# Big data
## What makes data big 

5V's of Big Data
- Volume, velocity, variety, veracity and value

How we build from bottom up from data to analytics. 

Since 1969
- Expenitial Growth across Tech, Economics, Finance, and Science (Underlying driver of what makes data big)
  - Computations Morse Law
    - The dependency for exponetial power to increase

4 Factors at play
- Storage cost (the ability to keep your data on a disk)
  - There has been a decrease in cost of storage cost
- CPU cost 
  -  the cost of CPU's have decreased 
- Network access 
  - People get on the internet and start to use connected services
  - Is the only one that has exponential increased
- Badwidth cost 
  - What it takes for all these computers to work together has expoentially decrease 

The effect of this increased exponentially the volume and velocity of data

Function of 3 things 
Exponential Growth (see above)
Real time networks 
  - Example is sensor netoworks (little computers on every player that gets stored at a location)
Cloud Computing 
  - Cluster computing 
    - Head node that is distributing the work to the worker nodes 
    - we can distribute computation and where we hold the data and we can do it from home
    - How do we process this data (Batch vs. Real time)
