# Coaches vs. Players Analytics 

Coaches need analytics to communicate what they want their players to do.  It gives them proof that the strategy they are telling them makes sense.  One of the hardest things to do is get a player to by in entirely to a coach's approach to the game.  Sometimes players revert to old habits, or they are not comfortable with their role. 
Data can show them why they are effective when they do what the coach asks them through metrics. 

Players need analytics to know what is working and what is not working.  If they are shooting a bunch of mid-range shots off the dribble from the wing, but they shoot a higher percentage from the elbow, this will allow them to see their sweet spot and start getting more shots from the elbow.  They may also begin practicing more wing pull up jump shots to get better at it. 

I think that teams also use analytics to access the coach's performance.  I believe that front office executives are always thinking of how to get better, and sometimes the coach is the one that is not
not doing the best job managing the talent.  

Everyone uses analytics in different ways, and it is vital to determine the best approach for a particular organization.
