# Project Overview 

## Project lifecycle 

1. Business Understanding

We are trying to access a shooters (overall) performance.  Look at the same position and group players that are in the same category! 

Chris Mullen
51% 2 point field goal, 38.4% 3 point field goal, 87% free throw
Hypothentical (88 Season Chris Mullen 54% 2 point, 43% three point, 89% free throw) 
Hypothetical  (08 season Malcom Brogdon 51% 2 point, 40% three point, 90% free throw)

I want to show that Chris Mullen had a better year because his performance was substatially better than Steph Curry in two categories. 

50 - 40 - 90 (8 players have made this happen and 5 of these players were league MVP's) only shows one season
Steve Nash 
Kevin Durant 
Larry Bird 
Mark Price 
Steph Curry 
Malcom Brogdon 
Dirk Nvisky 
Reggie Miller

I want to assume that these players best season shooting was their 50-40-90 year.  
Another player may have shot substatially better then these players by a 1% point or more for a duration of a season and 

2. Data Mining 
3. Data Cleaning 
4. Data Exploration

Pull up as much data as I can find and find out what each player 
We want season data for those players 

5. Feature Engineering

6. Predictive Modeling 
7. Data Visualization 

I am looking to talk to a NBA data scientist about this project.
