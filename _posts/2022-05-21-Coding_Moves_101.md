# Coding moves 101-1


This is our Director of Basketball Operations Adrian doing one of his drills to show his athletes again.  We created a game to show how to create the list of moves Adrian is doing using python.  I look forward to hearing everyones feedback. 

## BTE Trainer Coding Game

Question: How do you code these moves? 
- [BTE_Coding_Moves_Question](https://youtu.be/ZzAWoJuvpWA)

We only code the BTE Combo.  There are tradational dribbles, a full combo, and a BTE combo. 
- Dribbles = 1, 3, 2, 4 
- Full Combo = 1324
- BTE Combo = 324

### Create a list

- This is what a list looks like. Adrian does 1 combo so we add that next into the brackets
- `Combo1 = []` 

### Put your value into the list

- He does a 3(In & Out dribble), 2(Crossover), 4(Between the legs) BTE combo 
- `Combo1 = [324]`

### Multiply the list to get the exact amout of times the train

- He did the 324 BTE Combo 10 times so we multiplied the list times 10 to get our answer 
- `Combo1 = [324]*10`

Here is the answer to coding Adrians move sequence.
