# Coding moves 101


This is our Director of Basketball Operations Adrian doing one of his drills to show his athletes again.  We created a game to show how to create the list of moves Adrian is doing using python.  I look forward to hearing everyones feedback. 

## BTE Trainer Coding Game

Game: How do you play? First, we have to teach you the rules. 
- BTE Sequence = BTE Combo * Number of times the combo was done 
- The BTE Dribble Score has three different ways of calculation that is dependent on if the combo is a one, two, or three dribble sequence
- - BTE Dribble Score = (BTE dribble#) * Number of times the combo was done
- - BTE Dribble Score = (BTE dribble# + BTE dribble#) * Number of times the combo was done
- - BTE Dribble Score = (BTE dribble# + BTE dribble# + BTE dribble#) * Number of times the combo was done

- [BTE_Coding_Moves_Question](https://youtu.be/ZzAWoJuvpWA)
- How many times does he do the BTE Combo 324 sequence and what is his BTE Dribble Score?

We only code the BTE Combo to get the BTE Dribble Score.  There are tradational dribbles, a full combo, and a BTE combo. 
- Dribbles = 1, 3, 2, 4 
- Full Combo = 1324
- BTE Combo = 324

After watching Coach Adrian this is what I entered as my first line of code.

Here are an example of each of the dribbles Coach Adrian did. 
- `3` In & Out dribble where you fake a crossover dribble using one hand 
- `2` Crossover dribble where you change hands with the dribble in front of your body
- `4` Between the legs where the ball goes from one hand to the other with the ball landing between your legs exchanging hands

### Create a list

- This is what a list looks like. Adrian does 1 combo so we add that next into the brackets
- `Combo1 = []` 

### Put your value into the list

- He does a 3(In & Out dribble), 2(Crossover), 4(Between the legs) BTE combo 
- `Combo1 = [324]`
- ![324](https://media.giphy.com/media/OHih1Sk3I2hGBLcxcg/giphy.gif?raw=true)

### Multiply the list to get the exact amout of times the trainer does the move

- He did the 324 BTE Combo 7 times so we multiplied the list times 10 to get our answer for the sequences 
- `Combo1 = [324]*7`

Here is the answer to coding Coach Adrians move sequence and BTE Score below.

This is his actual answer where he messes up at 4 so his score at 3. So his score is below.
