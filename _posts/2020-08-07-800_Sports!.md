# 800 Sports!


I never knew there are 800 sports in the world.  This is amazing to me.  I will be going through this [list](https://www.topendsports.com/sport/list/index.htm).  
One of my goals is to make a sport.  I already have one in the works but I am not sure what it will evolve too.  It is amazing what happens if you just keep building and never stop.  If you think about a math sport similar to the "spelling b" but with a more active component, this is what we are building.  It has been a process of thought and iteration but I like where it is right now. 

I look forward to talking more about these sports in the upcoming days.  Some of them look interesting.  I have not seen one as interesting as ours yet :). 
Ours enables youth throughout the world to be ready for the next generation of jobs through our unique dribble tree system.  All they need is any type of ball and any type of basket.
