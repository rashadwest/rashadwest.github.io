# BTE BallCode

BTE BallCode is a coding game where we use sports to teach coding fundamentals. 

This is great because with our algo and partnerships we have multiple different offerings. The coding enables us to have the ability
to create basketball labs that include multiple different areas of sports science into our labs. 

We are also introducing different sports. Each sport has a unique element to it. 


We are looking forward to the future.
