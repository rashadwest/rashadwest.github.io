# Being able to get through errors 

I have been running into errors lately and instead of getting frustrated and going off and doing something else and then coming back I am going to 
try to figure it out myself more now.  I see that it is always simple mistakes.

Sometimes it is the simple things like the word areas and not area.

# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

```
# house information as list of lists
house = [["hallway", hall],
         ["kitchen", kit],
         ["living room", liv],
         ["bedroom", bed],
         ["bathroom", bath]]

# Print out house
print(house)

# Print out the type of house
print(type(house))
```
