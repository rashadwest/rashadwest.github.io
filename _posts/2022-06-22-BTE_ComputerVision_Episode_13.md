# Computer Vision 

We have been working on the concept for a minute. This means a long time in slang. Basically what we are doing is creating a system that calculates moves. 

A simple system that can make this happen everytime we put the camera on the person and total up the points. I don't need the equation.  

1. AI system
2. Advanced Computer vision algorithm that detects basketball moves
3. Arbitration engine that detects the human body and its various limbs' positions so that we know if the person is doing the move right
4. Scoring algorithm to measure the playerâ€™s skill and if they get the answer right

We will be working on this over the summer and I am excited. The next phase will be to incorporate this into an actual game.
