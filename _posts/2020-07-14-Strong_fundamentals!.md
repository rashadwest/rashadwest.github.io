# Strong fundamentals

I want to make sure I understand the fundamentals that will set the foundation for years to come for my company and my future in data science.

memory
- In computer science, in-memory processing is an emerging technology[citation needed] for processing of data stored in an in-memory database. Older systems have been based on disk storage and relational databases using SQL query language, but these are increasingly regarded as inadequate to meet business intelligence (BI) needs. Because stored data is accessed much more quickly when it is placed in random-access memory (RAM) or flash memory, in-memory processing allows data to be analysed in real time, enabling faster reporting and decision-making in business
data types
- a particular kind of data item, as defined by the values it can take, the programming language used, or the operations that can be performed on it.
servers and remote storage
- Local and Remote Servers. Local and remote TM1Â® servers provide access to cubes and data stored either on your computer or on other computers in your network. A local server gives you exclusive access to data and objects in a set of Windows folders called data directories.
databases
- a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.algorithms
algorithms
- a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
