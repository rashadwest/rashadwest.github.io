# Video Analysis 

We added something new to our video analysis. It is a mew form of measuring analytics using our unique metrics. This will be a fun journey.

1. We have our analyst talking through what happened in the game
2. We have the dribble combos used throughout the game 
3. We have the BTE Score of each combo 
4. We have the running BTE Score Total of each game

This is going to be a fun summer! Just think about a video game where you can keep the total score of a player using our system that totals up the value of their moves. 

I will show the video soon.
