The code below was right and I needed no hint and it all made sense.  I am getting somewhere. Stick with it. 

```
 # Create variables var1 and var2
var1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
var2 = True

# Print out type of var1
print(type(var1))

# Print out length of var1
print(len(var1))

# Convert var2 to an integer: out2
out2 = int(var2)
```
