# Terms on Terms
## You have to learn so many!

I will use this blog to add words or terms in which I may have some understanding but have to dive deeper.

1. Meta Data 
- a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.
  - literally data on data
2. Meta Learning
- Meta learning is a branch of metacognition concerned with learning about one's own learning and learning processes
  - the study of how people learn
3. Cloud Computing 
- Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user
  - You dont have to manage the computer power, resources, and data storage 
4. AWS
- Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.
  - A pay as you go cloud computing platform
5. Machine Learning 
- Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.
  - The computer learns from experience (reminds me alot of a human)
6. Data Simply 
- The cloud platform to enable impact investing for professional investors, leveraging machine intelligence and SASB standards.
  - Cloud platform for impact investing 
7. Domain Knowledge 
-  is understanding, ability and information that applies to a specific topic, profession or activity.
  - how much do you know 
8. Unsuperized learning 
- is a type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. The most common unsupervised learning method is cluster analysis, which is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or grouping in data.
  -  is a self-learning technique that uses input
9. Supervised learning 
- Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.
  - figuring out things about data without having to label it using both input and output
10. Artificial Intelligence 
- Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition and machine vision
