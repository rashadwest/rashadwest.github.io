t th# M2E 

I have been looking into more and more elements of our move to earn ideation. If you look at the move to earn space there are three main things I can point out. 

1. Inflationary 
2. Lacking real world integration 
3. Developing Skill 

Inflationary - this is a huge issue because of the fact that none of the M2E games have found a way to keep the coin sustainable even with the fact that everyone would 
love to walk and earn money. It still needs a burn or rebase model to keep it deflationary 

Lacking real world integration - We have yet to see some one bring the real world into the picture so much that it actually impacts rather or not a person is 
efficient and effective within the platform. 

Developing Skill - I have not see an application for skill development that truly rewards individuals for doing a new skill or developing a skill that they already have. 


These are just a few things I would love to see within the space of move to earn to help move it forward.
