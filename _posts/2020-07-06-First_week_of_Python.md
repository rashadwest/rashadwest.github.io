## Learning the basics

Operation with other types 

I struggled with this example. The instructions got me confused.  I have listed them below.

Calculate the product of savings and growth_multiplier. Store the result in year1.
- To me I thought to put the code below for this one so I got this right.
```
growth_multipler * savings = year1
```
What do you think the resulting type will be? Find out by printing out the type of year1.
- I had no idea what to do here because we never talked about this type formula.  How was I supposed to figure this out.  I think I will try to use stack overflow next time.

Calculate the sum of desc and desc and store the result in a new variable doubledesc.
- This was pretty easy

Print out doubledesc. Did you expect this?
- I forgot how to print.  Now I know it is like below. 
```
print()
```

This is the solution below

```savings = 100
growth_multiplier = 1.1
desc = "compound interest"

# Assign product of savings and growth_multiplier to year1
year1 = savings * growth_multiplier

# Print the type of year1
print(type(year1))

# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc = desc + desc

# Print out doubledesc
print(doubledesc)
```
