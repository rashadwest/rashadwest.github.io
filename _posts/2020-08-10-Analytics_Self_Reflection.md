#Analytics Self Reflection

#The future of basketball players using analytics 

I did not use analytics much in my playing career for development.  Mostly because I was unaware of the advanced analytics that started to formulate in the early 2000s.  I feel like there was something about the added anxiety and pressure of looking at my statistics
that made me resist looking into more data or analysis.  It would be great for someone to create a survey that finds out about player analytics usage. 

While looking at other player's statistics and scouting them, I was only comparing my performance. I frequently think about how I should have spent more time looking at individual's tapes to see their tendencies on offense and defense.  Also, I should have watched more of my film.  I think the coaches make the film study challenging.  Every time a team has a film study, the coaches are cursing at the players for mistakes.  Rarely is there a time where they are praising you.n 

I watch the film again and again and never is there a time where I was pleased with my performance.  I was so critical of myself and my performance. I think it stunted my growth.  I wouldn't say I liked watching myself play much, but I desperately wanted to get better.  I believe analytics can help players get out of this mindset of perfectionism.
