# JCSU

I had a fantastic time talking at JCSU. It was a faster talk than usual that was about 20 minutes. We had technical difficulties at first and then we figured it out. 

Dr. Lindsey and Dr. BerNadette were both on the call as well. They aslo have an esports team and lab that I think is really cool. I can not wait to go by their office in Charlotte 
and seeing everything they have going on. They want me to do 

1. The students wanted to know who was my favorite player I have worked on so far 
2. I used a different version of my deck so I talked about what we are looking to do with Blockchain as well (I wonder if they followed it)
3. I could not see the class because it was on zoom so I am not sure about engagement 
4. My main purpose is to tell the community about emerging technology and opportunities in sports outside of agent or player. 

Here is the health and career event that they want me to be involved in below. This is an amazing event for the community. They have free haircuts, testing, and career opportunities. I love when HBCU's are doing things like this for the students.

It was a fantastic experience and I look forward to this in March 2023.
