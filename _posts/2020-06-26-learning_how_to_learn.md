# Learning how to learn
## Enjoying the journey

As I struggled the first week to get the GitHub pages up I realized that I was doing things all wrong.  I will be changing the process of learning more to
this approach below.

Read the instructions once in your head
Re-read the instructions aloud
Write down what is being asked of you in your own words
If you are reading documentaion about something unfamiliar just to understand how it works, write down terms that you do not understand

After watching the video for learning how to learn a second time it really makes sense that you have to know how your brain functions to be effiecient and effective. Barbra Oakley was able to go from a mediocre student to a PHD in engineering through rethinking learning.  This made me really interested in what
she was teaching and what was being taught. 

I will update this post a bunch as I am still learning my learning style.  I never really applied myself in school so now is the time to do so.  I will be taking the course learning how to learn so I will let you know how that goes over the next couple of weeks.
