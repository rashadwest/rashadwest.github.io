![Building value in AI](https://github.com/rashadwest/rashadwest.github.io/blob/master/_posts/AI.png?raw=true)

How can you be successful in business or investing?  Build a platform that is a solid foundation and making it a sustainable product that adds value. 

The ability to create value applies to brands, people, products, and platforms.  It is the ingredients that make things happen!  I want to add value, and that is what I am building.  

This is what being an entrepreneur or athlete is all about! 

AI is something I am watching closely because of how much value can be created.  IBM has made AI-powered highlight reels through monitoring the sound in stadiums for five years from all of the matches.  It has enabled them to understand a matches crowd noise and sounds from a first-round match to the finals.  

This can be used for the covid world we live in right now to make us feel like we are watching a match with the crowd when no one is there.  

They have also used AI for language and natural language understanding to know the mental state of elite athletes and coaches.  IBM Watson has a great system where they work with language.  

Second spectrum is doing things for the fan experience.  They are adding items into the sports experience.  

They are betting on a future that people will want to interact with the video.  Interactive video is the future, and I agree that people will love that! 

In 5 years, the CEO of Second Specturm says every sports video will be watched (pickup games, practice, refereed games, etc.) by machines and is edited, augmented, streamed, and watched by people in a new way.
