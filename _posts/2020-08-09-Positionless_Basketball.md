# Positionless Basketball 

## Who did it the best?

The Golden State Warriors started a trend that will last for a long time.  They started a different type of basketball that is unique.  The ability of their players to shoot the ball from range was one of the determining factors of their success this decade. 
Although this was the main attribute of their playing style there was one other huge thing.  They could put 5 players on the court that can dribble pass and shoot and also guard multiple positions. 

The Houston Rockets are given credit for making this style into a starting line up but the Golden State Warriors were the ones that made this style amazing.  The line up would be Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Andre Iguodala.

I think this line up makes it hard for the Houston Rockets to stack up.  Although they are great in their own way they do not have the shooting ability that this Golden State Warriors team that won a championship.  I hope they prove me wrong!
