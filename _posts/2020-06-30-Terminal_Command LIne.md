Terminal + The command line

The struggle is real.  Even as I have tried to do the course that my teacher Alivia mentioned I struggled to download what I needed.  Now I have to go back and
figure it out.

I am starting to understand the command line more.  I use cd and ls a bunch.  
- ls shows all of the files 
- cd helps me chose a file
