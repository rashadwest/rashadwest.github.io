# Shot Plot 

## How can I execute a shot plot using data science?

I am going to create a shot plot.  I know I need to get the x,y axis and that is what I am working on now.

What else do I need is the question.

Second Spectrum is a platform that tracks data and analytics at a high level
(EFG) Effective Field Goal Percentage 
(ESQ) Effective Shot Quality
(SQ) Shot Quality 

I want to create a shot plot that is calculating shot difficulty eventually as well.
