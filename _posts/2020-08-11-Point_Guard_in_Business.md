# Point Guard in Business 
 
# I learned how to manage our team from my playing days

I have learned so much about business over the past couple of years.  It is similar to sports.  It makes me think about all of my coaches and general managers.  I 
have taken a part of each persons style and have incorporated it into how I manage our team.
