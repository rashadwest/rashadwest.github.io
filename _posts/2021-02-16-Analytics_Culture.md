# Analytics Culuture
Here is an advanced analytic where we have developed an advanced analytic called the Beat The Expert (BTE) box score.  The box score uses our court plotting system to determine where you are on the court when you shoot the ball. 
The plotting system enables an individual to determine location by color.  This color pattern gives fans, general managers, data scientists, statisticians, and analysts a way of knowing where a player is without needing a shot plot.  

Each square represents a color from the color grid.  It teaches individual colors and where the colors are on the color wheel.  It also lets the player know where they are on the court at any time.  Within the box score, there are boxes.  Each box represents a score.  The key is below.  Let me know if you can predict your favorite player's primary color if we were to do a career chart on him or her.  You can send me an email to rashad@beattheexpert.com. 

Lastly, this analytic is educational.  The unique analytic is teaching individuals the color wheel.  We are a S.T.E.A.M (Science, Technology, Enginerring, Art, and Mathmatics) platform.  


Each color represents a location and it also shows rather a player scored or not.

This is the key to understanding the system.

This is also the color map.  It is wrapped on the court for us to determine location and to teach the color wheel.

If you look at Shaqs box score it is all in the paint so it is mostly the same color.

Klay has more colors in his box score because he is a perimeter scorer.
