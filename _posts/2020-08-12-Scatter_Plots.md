# Scatter Plots 

## Huge moment for me 

I learned how to do scatter plots by myself without any help from my instructor today.  It was a big accomplishment for me. 

Here is what the scatter plot looks like. This particular scatter plot is for FGs vs. FG% for Chris Mullens best season.

I will proceed to play around with this data set.  Soon I will start working on the data set that will enable me to determine who the best point guard 
shooter of all time is.  I just need a little more practice :).
