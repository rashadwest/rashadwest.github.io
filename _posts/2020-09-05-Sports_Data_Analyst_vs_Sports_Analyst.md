# Sports Data Analyst vs. Sports Analyst

![](https://github.com/rashadwest/rashadwest.github.io/blob/master/_posts/data-sports.jpg?raw=true)

When looking at sports analysis, I do not think they do an excellent job distinguishing the two different analyst types.  
Here is how I define a "Sports Data Analyst" and a "Sports Analyst."
t
Sports Data Analyst 
- A Sports data analyst is an individual that looks at all factors, including data & analytics, when assessing performance and can build or create models for their research. They can
create different algorithms to prove their point and know how to access the players from a quantitative perspective.  

Sports Analyst 
- A sports analyst is an individual who bases their analysis on their experience from playing the game or writing about the game.  They base their analyst on their expert opinion
and do not focus on the quantitative aspect of the game.  

I think this will change as the data and analytics departments in sports continue to grow.  People will know the difference between analysts.
