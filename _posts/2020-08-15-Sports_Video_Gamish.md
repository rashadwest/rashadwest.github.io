# Sports Video Gamish

## Video game type basketball is next 

Watching NBA playoffs today, I saw the shot clock graphic, and it made me think about the future of basketball.

I see every basketball "analyst" use graphics when they show basketball clips.  I think it is only a matter of time before the game has graphics elements displayed while games are being played.  It may start where only the fans can see the graphics.  Eventually, it will develop into a video game feel closer to the game NBA Jam.  

Sports will have to start to appeal to the up and coming video game generation soon.  Appealing to this audience will make the game look completely different from a consumer standpoint.
