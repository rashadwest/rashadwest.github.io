![BTE Dribble Plot](https://github.com/rashadwest/rashadwest.github.io/blob/master/_posts/BTE_JaMorant_44_12_23_2020.png?raw=true)

This game against the Spurs put Ja Morant on the map as a legit scorer.

We have created a new dribble plot.  This dribble plot has a couple of components to it.  

We have a unique proprietary system
2. Each dribble has a color 
3. Each dribble has a number 
4. Each dribble has a shape 

Why did we do this? 

1. You can determine dribble combinations off attacking moves 
2. You can determine which moves create the most space 
3. This can help a player determine which moves to use and when 
4. Defenders can also use this for tendencies in attack moves from players

I will fill you in with more about our new dribble plot when I start our youtube channel this weekend.
