![BTE Dribble Plot](https://github.com/rashadwest/rashadwest.github.io/blob/master/_posts/BTE_JaMorant_44_12_23_2020.png)

We have created a new dribble plot.  This system has a couple components to it.  

1. We create a number system for each dribble 
2. Each dribble has a color 
3. Each dribble has a number 
4. Each dribble has a shape 

Why did we do this? 

1. You can determine dribble combinations off attacking moves 
2. You can determine which moves create the most space 
3. This can help a player also determine which moves to use when 
4. Defenders can also use this for tendancies in attack moves from players

I will fill you in with more about our new dribble plot when I start our youtube channel this weekend.
