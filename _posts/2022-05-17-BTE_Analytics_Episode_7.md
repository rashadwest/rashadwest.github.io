# Analytics start 

A note I sent myself when I first started on this journey. 

This is how it all started with analytics. I was in NYC working at General Assembly part time and working out for basketball.  I started to record 
basketball training audio with crowd noise to work out by myself.  That was the first version of the virtual trainer.  

I was trying to figure out how to create a game where each player was able to think the game and make their IQ better through training virtually. 

I used Stockton and Malone and created a multiple choice scenario where the game stoped the video and then you had to predict what the answer is on youtube as well. 

I was experimenting with everything and I am now starting to realize it was just a process of a inventor.

I never saw the fact that I will ever use VR.

Fast forward to today.  I do not know what really pushed me to use VR besides a couple of facts that I can remember below.  


Why VR?

1. It was the future 
2. Then I said I know there is a time where games and sports would mix so how can I help create this experience 
3. I also knew that I wouold get the full attention of my clients and I could scale my training business.
4. Lastly, I thought that I can be a technologist and create change  

Why AR?
1. We think it enables a person to do everything I want them to do on the court
2. We can teach them from a quant perspective 
3. We can teach them data science or math 
4. We can gamify basketball and crypto 
5. We can create international competition
