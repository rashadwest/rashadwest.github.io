# Presentation 

## Creating a presentation for my project 

I will be working with my friend Ray tonight to talk about this presentaiton/deck. He is a person who great at creating these types of presentaiton for companies. 

Here is what I am looking to focus on:

1. Start with the end project and how that looks
2. Basketball Anayltics 
3. Basketball League that is virtual 
4. Basketball Curriculum and Mathmatical system 
5. Show key metrics and how we can take off this year 


There will not be college sports so this is a huge opportunity for us to move forward and get viral growth.  Show how we are going to do this.  Our goal is to get this launched by November! 

I am pumped!
