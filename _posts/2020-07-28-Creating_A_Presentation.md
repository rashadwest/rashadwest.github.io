# Presentation for the Youth

## Creating a presentation for my project (Shad loves the kids)

I will be working with my friend Ray tonight to talk about this presentaiton/deck. He is a person who great at creating these types of presentaiton for companies. 

Here is what I am looking to focus on:

1. Start with the end project and how that looks
2. Basketball Anayltics 
3. Basketball League that is virtual 
4. Basketball Curriculum and Mathmatical system 
5. Show key metrics and how we can take off this year 


There will not be college sports so this is a huge opportunity for us to move forward and get viral growth.  Show how we are going to do this.  Our goal is to get this launched by November! 

I am pumped! 

## The Future of Interactive Learning | Presentation notes
 ## With my guy Ray Sutton 

Big Idea:
League vs. WebApp

Notes:
How does Tik tok & Instagram look for people who create
Seeing the kids on Steam 

What is the big picture of what I am doing?
Lebrons Media company hosting our show parntering with the NBA and it being the biggest 

It may need to be easier to access the curriculum.  

STEAM (E)sports: 
- This is so new who can help us?
- How much do they charge? What is our focus?
- Doing the AR is different for this.
- These are the top esports teams.

School Districts:
- Get a free trial for my people

Strategic standpoint
- (e)sport element of it should wait 

Money:
- Finding money 
- Figuring out the compelling story

How do I convert these views into dollars?
- Sponsors 
- TV deal, etc. 

Having the app at the same time with everything else
1. Educational platform that is extremely compelling that is going to make kids want to learn
2. League of its own that can be created (plan for the league)
3. Viral Growth 

Figure out a way to give them the evolution of the product!
