# Analytics Agent 

I have seen that there is something new Kevin De Bruyne has pointed that out in the sports industry. He has executed a huge contract with his team without an agent.

They gamified the agency process by showing a player’s value. If you look at this image, it shows how he probably showed his value. As you see this 

TransferLab photo of Leah Williamson it explains a lot in one image. 

It shows her vitals, including height, weight, etc like most platforms. It goes into more details as it talks about the quality of her game, including short passes, long passes, tackles, interceptions, etc. This is all great, but what is interesting is it shows player potential.

We think we are doing something similar to our platform. If players want to see their value, they can come to us. I would not suggest they get rid of their agent because a bunch of players are not business savvy and need to focus on their craft. I think the time is coming where every player is going to hire an analytic company to show their value. 

There are multiple players that are represented by their family members. Lionel Messi is represented by his father Jorge and Sergio Ramos represented by his brother Rene. 

In the basketball space, Kyrie Irving is represented by his mother Shetellia and Mike Conley is represented by his father, Mike Conley Sr. The one thing that most of us realize is negotiation is a skill. I have never heard about negotiators using advanced analytics, but I want to ask what if they did? Would they increase the deal by multiple basis points for their client?

Things based on facts, even if it is a niche element of advanced analytics, that proves a player’s worth. Is it worth an agency partnering with an analytics company? 

Everything we do at [Beat The Expert](http://staging.beattheexpert.com/?raw=true) is proprietary data and we have just expanded our offerings past STEM and emerging technology to analytics. 

It would be great to work with agents on helping them get their players a fair deal along with players, scouts, and coaches to help them get the best results by using predictive 

analytics with unique insights.
