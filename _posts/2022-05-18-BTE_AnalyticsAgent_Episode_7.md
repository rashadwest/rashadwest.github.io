# Analytics Agent 

I have seen that there is something new Kevin De Bruyne has pointed that out in the sports industry. He has executed a huge contract with his soccer team without an agent. He negotiated a 4 year 83 million euro contract. This made me research what made him want to do this alone. 

He leaned completely on the data. Data and analytics will revolutionize sports in ways we can not imagine. Players that understand how to read the numbers will not only be great, but they will know their worth. This agency did something that has put the industry on notice. They gamified the agency process by showing a player’s value. If you look at this image, it shows how he probably showed his value. As you see this 

TransferLab photo of Lauren Hemp it explains a lot in one image. 

It shows her vitals, including height, weight, etc like most platforms. It goes into more details as it talks about the quality of her game, including short passes, long passes, tackles, interceptions, etc. This is all great, but what is interesting is it shows player potential.

We think we are doing something similar to our platform. If players want to see their value, they can come to us. I would not suggest they get rid of their agent because a bunch of players are not business savvy and need to focus on their craft. I think the time is coming where every player is going to hire an analytic company to show their value. 

There are multiple players that are represented by their family members. Lionel Messi is represented by his father Jorge and Sergio Ramos represented by his brother Rene. 

In the basketball space, Kyrie Irving is represented by his mother Shetellia and Mike Conley is represented by his father, Mike Conley Sr. The one thing that most of us realize is negotiation is a skill. I have never heard about negotiators using advanced analytics, but I want to ask what if they did? Would they increase the deal by multiple basis points for their client?

Things based on facts, even if it is a niche element of advanced analytics, that proves a player’s worth. Is it worth an agency partnering with an analytics company? 

AnalyticsFC says their “algorithm takes a large range of metrics, such as expected goals and expected assists, and works out the effect a player has had on their team’s chances of scoring or conceding goals. This contribution value can then be benchmarked against players bracketed in the same age category and position from different leagues.” I would like to see how accurate their predictive analytic has been. 

Everything we do at [Beat The Expert](http://staging.beattheexpert.com/?raw=true)(BTE) is proprietary data and we have just expanded our offerings past STEM and emerging technology to analytics. 

It would be great to work with agents on helping them get their players a fair deal along with players, scouts, and coaches to help them get the best results by using predictive analytics with unique insights.

"One Premier League data scientist told TGG he expected all leading players to come into contract negotiations with a ‘portfolio’ like this within the next three years."

This is the first time a player has reached out to the company in soccer and we think Beat The Expert will be the first in basketball. We will rank players a little different.  We will show the head to head match up.  Unique data against unique data. BTE will be different in this regard.

Michael Jordan(Charlotte Hornets) was a player and now owner who partnered up with another owner Mark Cuban(Dallas Mavericks) to make an investment in an analytic company [Sportradar](https://thesportsrush.com/nba-news-michael-jordan-and-mark-cuban-turned-a-44-million-investment-into-8-billion-how-the-bulls-legend-and-mavs-owner-joined-forces-and-earned-themselves-a-huge-payday/) that turned their 44 million dollar investment into 8 billion dollar IPO.  It is reported that Jordan earned 350 million in the company going public. 

I wonder what player or agent will invest in their future both now and for the future. "Beat the expert" is next up to bat and we are swinging for the fences.
