# You Got This!
## I literally have to build my foudnation for learning 

Here are the steps I will try to take more often.

Read the instructions once in your head
- Learning to do this every time

Re-read the instructions aloud
- I rarely did this in the past but now I will.  I think this is so helpful.  It just helps you process it. 

Write down what is being asked of you in your own words
- I did not really take good notes in the past so this is something that I am working on. Alivia told me to start using color pencils and drawing stuff as well and I am thinking about that now.

If you are reading documentaion about something unfamiliar just to understand how it works, write down terms that you do not understand
- I will start writing down the terms I do not know and then research them and define them and put that definition in my own words. 

This week I achevied something;
This week our goal was to successfully create a github page and as it turns out there is documentaion that exists which walk you through creating a GitHub Page, this information is laid out as a course. Check it out. Click through the pages before you read any of the material and look at the images on the page. Even before you read about how to actually create the page take time to explore what currently exists. You will have questions and this is a good thing, make sure that you think about what those questions are and preceisly what doesn't make sense to you. Write down your questions.

As I browse through the first page of the course I notice a requirement for taking the course is completion of another course, the introduction to GitHub course. If you don't currently understand how GitHub works then taking that course is a requirement and you should take the time to work through that course first.

What if after exploring the documentation I'm still stuck?
