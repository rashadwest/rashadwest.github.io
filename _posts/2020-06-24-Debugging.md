# Debugging 

It was a struggle when I first started out trying to figure out how to debug some of the issues when creating my blog. 
I now understand the process.  You have to read everything out loud and think what is it I need to find out to fix the problem. 
It takes a certain type of patience to do anything in CS. 

I have started the course learning how to learn.  This has started to get me to do some things between my lessons so I can use 
both the diffuse mode and the focus mode.  I sometimes stop and play some chess and then go back to work.  I want to try the falling alseep 
with something in my hand and then go right back to work when I wake up and see how I do. 

Especially sense I am doing something brand new.  I will have to use parts of my brain that I have never used before.  I have not learned 
another language good sense english.  I am proficient in Spanish but I learned that just from embracing myself in their culture while I was 
playing basketball.  

I am playing on starting the learning how to learn book by Barbra Oakley on July 9th.  I am excited about that as well.  One of the reason
I am excited is because I never really applied myself in school so I do not really know how to learn exactly.  I did not do much trial and 
error while I was in school.  I was just thinking how can I get this done and get a good great with the least effort. 

It has carried over some to everything.  I think this mentality is good when I am already in a place of understaning and/or I am in a managment
type position and can deligate.  It is not a good menality when I need to learn something new or work on something new. 

I will work daily on this.
