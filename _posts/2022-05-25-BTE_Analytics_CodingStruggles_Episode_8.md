# Coding Struggles 

I have been working on two things all day today. 

1. Developing our coding system for our algorithm.

  - I have developed a couple of ways of extracting the data we need using python 
  - Now I am looking to take it straight from the csv file 

2. Importing a CSV or excel file into a jupiter notebook. 

  - Right now I am using google colab and the challenge I am having is error code after error code.
  - I am going to look into more ways to add the file

  - ![Struggle2](https://github.com/rashadwest/rashadwest.github.io/blob/master/_posts/Struggle2.png?raw+true)


I need to work on being more productive when I cannot accomplish a goal that I wanted to accomplish on the workday.
