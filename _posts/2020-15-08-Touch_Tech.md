# Touch Tech 

The NBA has to look into technology to see who has possession of the ball.  It takes to long at the end of games to watch the game tape repeatedly to find out who has possession. 
There should eventually be sensors in the ball that can sense touch.  It can judge how many times the ball was touched throughout a sequence.  

Maybe not that intense of a technology system, but a way that the game is not stopped at the end of the game.  The same issue comes up in soccer and football as well.  

I have seen some technology at the Consumer Electronic Show (CES) that might help with this.  The ability to stop a video image and zoom in from all angles to see if the ball changes directions
or if the hand hits the ball.  

I also think about the Oculus hand tracking technology.  If they can incorporate your hands into virtual reality, I believe that that same tech can track your hand and body in sports. 

It will be interesting to see the enhancements in this area as they enhance the game.
