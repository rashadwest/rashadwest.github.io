# Major Payne
## The Command Line + Terminal were brutal for me 

Udacity offers a free course Linux and the command line which takes about 5 hours to complete. The course covers:
- Maybe I will look into this when I get some time.

Getting into the shell - learn how to enter commands in the shell and interpret their output
- This was challeging a first because none of the language I was using made sense 

Shell commands - explore common shell commands, and more importantly, learn how to use the Unix manual to learn more
- This is interesting because I was not sure how deep the shell commands went but know I know there are a bunch

The Linux Filesystem - learn how the linux filesystem is organized. Navigate directories and organize files from shell commands.
- I still need to go back and do this.
