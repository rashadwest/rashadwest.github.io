# Speaking Education

The current excercise I am doing is about education and I was also introduced to this great resource below that helps you compute complex equations and explains the output.

```
# Select educ
educ = gss['educ']

# Bachelor's degree
bach = gss(educ >= 16)

# Associate degree
assc = gss(educ >= 14 & educ < 16)

# High school
high = (educ <= 12)
print(high.mean())
```

Speaking of education I think this is a really useful and cool tool that I will use for sure in the near future.  This will help with data science no question.
