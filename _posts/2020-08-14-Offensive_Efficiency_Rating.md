# How the Bulls changed the game 

Phil Jackson and Tex Winter changed the game.  They did it by using advanced analytics.  They would analyze their offense by having Tex Winter chart every possession.  This is how Tex Winter made the game simple.  He was an individual who paid attention to detail. They did not mention the use of code or a computer.  They charted everything by hand.  I think it is essential to make sure we still keep things simple.

Phil and Tex would do that while incorporating the innovative triangle offense.  This offense emphasized ball movement and teamwork.  Their style would give this tandem nine championships with the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers. "I wasn't an excellent coach and didn't have a lot of knowledge, and he had a lot of knowledge, He's like the mind of the basketball gods," this is what legendary coach Phil Jackson had to say about Tex Winters.

These gentlemen used the offensive effciency rating to their advantage.  Their success as coaches has me thinking more and more about what analytics are.  It is not sitting at the computer and coding.  Analytics definition is "the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics." 

I have been working on AR/VR, along with data and analytics within the game.  What the game looks like now will drastically change in the next couple of years.  I will be able to help it evolve more into something the video game generation likes.
