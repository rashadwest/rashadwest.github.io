# GitHub

GitHub was very confusing at first because of the way it is layed out.  Now that I have spent some time on it it is starting to make sense.
I understand how to collaborate on it now that me and Alivia have started to use it.  It is amazing that I can collaborate with people who can 
assist me when I may not know something through using GitHub.  

I use the repo a bunch but I need to get out and explore a bit more throughout GitHub now.  Wish me louck!
