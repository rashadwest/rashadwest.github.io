# 4-Dimensional_Space

I am doing a history lesson on 4D.  After watching the Lakers vs. Rockets game's ESPN highlights, the commentator said that Lebron dunked the ball in 4D.  
Interestingly, I think that most people only know about 3-dimensional spaces.  Bringing on a 4th variable enables individuals to play around with space more.
I grabbed the information below from Wikipedia to go into further detail about 4D. 

"A four-dimensional space or 4D space is a mathematical extension of three-dimensional or 3D space. 
Three-dimensional space is the simplest possible abstraction of the observation that one only needs three numbers, called dimensions, to describe the 
sizes or locations of objects in the everyday world.

In 1880, Charles Howard Hinton popularized these insights in an essay titled "What is the Fourth Dimension?", which explained the concept of a four-dimensional 
cube with a step-by-step generalization of the properties of lines, squares, and cubes. The simplest form of Hinton's method is to draw two ordinary cubes separated by an "unseen" 
distance, and then draw lines between their equivalent vertices. This can be seen in the accompanying animation, whenever it shows 
a smaller inner cube inside a larger outer cube. The eight lines connecting the vertices of the two cubes in that case represent a single direction in the "unseen" fourth dimension."

How is 4D used?
I have heard it talked about in data science, and this has made me curious.  So I will explore it more.
