# Data Science fundamentals 

- Memory
  - This uses RAM or Flash memory as a way of storing data and it works better for data anaytics and business intelligence
- Data types
  - I think about this like all of the different methods used like text, numbers, lists, etc.
- Servers and remote storage
  - Some servers are local but AWS and Azure are servers that are in the cloud and they can also use GPS so you do not have to do local at all and you can borrow computing power
- Databases
  - This is where data is stored and analyzed 
- Algorithms
  - A set of instructions that a human uses to tell a computer what to do
