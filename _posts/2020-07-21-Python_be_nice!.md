# Python be Nice!

The moment I think I am getting somewhere I then get humbled.  I was learning how to slice and dice my list and then I have some issues on how to do it after running 
my code.  Here is what I put and the output I recieved.  I did it without errors but it not giving me the correct answer when I run it.  It is asking it I ran 
downstairs without errors and I did. 

This is the most frustrating part about coding.  Where is the AI that tells you what you did wrong?


Here is the problem set that they had and it was my job to print out the first 6 items out of the list for downstairs and then the last for of the list for upstairs
and that is what I thought I did.  Here is the input:
```
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Use slicing to create downstairs
downstairs_list = areas[0:6]
downstairs_list

# Use slicing to create upstairs
upstairs_list = areas[6:11]   
upstairs_list

# Print out downstairs and upstairs
print(upstairs_list)
```

Here is the Output:
```
In [12]: # Create the areas list
         areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]
         
         # Use slicing to create downstairs
         downstairs_list = areas[0:6]
         downstairs_list
         
         # Use slicing to create upstairs
         upstairs_list = areas[6:11]   
         upstairs_list
         
         # Print out downstairs and upstairs
         print(upstairs_list)
         print(downstairs_list)
['bedroom', 10.75, 'bathroom', 9.5]
['hallway', 11.25, 'kitchen', 18.0, 'living room', 20.0]
```

It turns out I just printed the upstairs and downstairs out of order.  Attention to detail ladies and gentlemen!

```
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Alternative slicing to create downstairs
downstairs = areas[:6]

# Alternative slicing to create upstairs
upstairs = areas[6:]
```

Another example I did this right but I did not think to put downstairs = areas[:6].  Instead I put downstairs[:6] like the example but it was not reading the area.  I want to try to retain this stuff as much as possible. 

Below was an euphoric moment for me.  I figured out how to think about this problem.  At first I did not know what they were talking about. Then I ran some of the code and then looked back at what values were printed for floats in the previous excercise.  I wonder if this is the only way to go about this.  I will ask Alivia tomorrow.

On this one I do not understand what I did wrong.  I cannot wait to see the results.  They are starting to make it fun as I feel like I am invloved in building a house.

```
# Create the areas list and make some changes
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "chill zone", 20.0,
         "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 10.50]

# Add poolhouse data to areas, new list is areas_1
areas_1 = areas + ["poolhouse", float(24.5)]

# Add garage data to areas_1, new list is areas_2
areas_2 = areas + ["garage", float(15.45)]
```

This is what it should look like!
```
# Create the areas list and make some changes
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "chill zone", 20.0,
         "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 10.50]

# Add poolhouse data to areas, new list is areas_1
areas_1 = areas + ["poolhouse", 24.5]

# Add garage data to areas_1, new list is areas_2
areas_2 = areas + ["garage", 15.45]
```

The solution was the number without the float().  I am confused on when to use this and when not too.  It worked so I am thinking I could use it.  This is another quesiton I have.  


I want to understand this question so bad but I dont

Baseball players' height
You are a huge baseball fan. You decide to call the MLB (Major League Baseball) and ask around for some more statistics on the height of the main players. They pass along data on more than a thousand players, which is stored as a regular Python list: height_in. The height is expressed in inches. Can you make a numpy array out of it and convert the units to meters?

height_in is already available and the numpy package is loaded, so you can start straight away (Source: stat.ucla.edu).

Instructions
0 XP
Create a numpy array from height_in. Name this new array np_height_in.
Print np_height_in.
Multiply np_height_in with 0.0254 to convert all height measurements from inches to meters. Store the new values in a new array, np_height_m.
Print out np_height_m and check if the output makes sense.

Here is the answer
```
# height is available as a regular list

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a numpy array from height_in: np_height_in
np_height_in = np.array(height_in)

# Print out np_height_in
print(np_height_in)

# Convert np_height_in to m: np_height_m
np_height_m = np_height_in * 0.0254

# Print np_height_m
print(np_height_m)
```
This question is so confusing to me.  I do not understand why there is nothing under the first hashtag.  I also do not understand how i am using np in front of the value for the first numpy array.

It is also tough for me to understand why the number is being multiplied as a single value float.  I have never seen that before without brackets or parenthesis. 

Examples of Data Types
- Integer = 26
- String = '26'
- variable = twenty_six 
- float = 26.01
- Bool = True
