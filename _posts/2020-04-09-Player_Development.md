# Player Development 

![](https://github.com/rashadwest/rashadwest.github.io/blob/master/_posts/Steph.png?raw=true)

We have to hold players accountable.  I have a list of things in which I believe should be focus areas for player development. Players should ask themselves if they can do better in each statistical category.   

1. How much time do you put in during the offseason on your weaknesses on the court? 
2. How much time do you put in making your body healthier and stronger?
3. How much quality sleep do you get on a nightly basis?
4. How quickly do you retain information from your coach and peers?
5. Do you do what your coach asks of you?
6. Are you efficient and effective in your role on the court?
7. Do you make your teammates better?
8. How much time do you watch your film?
9. Do you know all of the plays?
10. Do you understand advanced metrics?
