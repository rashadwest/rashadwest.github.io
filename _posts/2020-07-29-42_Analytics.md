# 42 Analytics 
## MIT SSAC 

Sports as we know them are changing.  I think that there will be a unique mix of the physical elements and technology.  What we have seen throughout the years 
will start to change before our eyes at a rapid pace over these next couple of years.  I am excited to be part of the revolution.  I am also excited because I will not only be a fan but also a producer in the industry. 

I will take even more of a deep dive into the resources here in the videos below.  They talk about everything sports tech related.  I will focus on the basketball 
analytics videos and documentation.  I think that a bunch of my trainer and coaching friends will be coming to me for advice which I will tell them I can not help them.  I am just kidding.  I will always help my people! It will be fun as well!

In this blog I will post some of the things I am learning. 

This channel is everything sports analytics.  They tackle all the problems in the world of sports technology!
