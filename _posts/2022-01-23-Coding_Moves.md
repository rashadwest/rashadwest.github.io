# Coding moves

Zaila was working on her moves and I took each move and showed it by creating a box score of her moves.  I am looking to do this for professional players this week manually to figure out the best way to show how effective players are with certain moves.

This is our Director of Basketball Operations Adrian doing one of his drills to show his athletes.  We created a game to show how to create the list of moves Adrian is doing using python.  I look forward to hearing everyones feedback.
