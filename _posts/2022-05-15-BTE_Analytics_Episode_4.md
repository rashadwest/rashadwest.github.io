Steph is a monster in shooting, and I think he may be the best to shoot both stationary and off the dribble. 

Steph is amazing at shooting off the dribble. As you can see here, he was shooting 58% when catching and shooting and 61% off the dribble. 

We are currently looking at what dribbles Steph is more efficient with, but after watching him similar to Kyrie, he is best off of his 1 dribble.  

Steph is a little different, however. Kyrie looks for the pick and roll or pin down action where Steph is constantly moving and trying to get a catch and shoot or catch and re-locate. 

I plan to look at the top 9 games of Steph and Kyrie this week.  If you wonder why it is 9 games, it is because I cannot find one of Stephsâ€™ games film.
