## Yo, I am Rashad West

 I learned what a Jupiter notebook today.  It was a journey but I am starting to figure it out.  You can run commands similar to the commands in the terminal.  It also hosts data.
 The google collab I am using has a better text editor, rich text, and the ability to create more graphical capabilities.    

We downloaded Pandas library.  I am excited because this is for the python language to deal with data and analytics.  I had to enter the Panda notebook through using the pd commands.  One of the lines we used was "import pandas as pd".
All of these command lines were given to me through a resource that had a bunch of information on the download.  It is interesting because not a bunch happens when you download it.
In collab if the command line works it doesnt do anything which is different than the terminal.  Once it was added then I was able to add data to collab and that got me excited!

Then you have to run commands to gt the data to show up in the text editor.  I learned that CSV files are generally faster and less complicated than XLS files.  

We added the data by going to file and uploading the CSV file.  We uses cat "("Chris_Mullen_88.csv")" to access our data. We then used the line "dataframe = pd.read_csv("Chris_Mullen_88.csv")" and then "dataframe" to put our data into a dataframe. 
A dataframe is a two column array like structure that contains values.  Some of the file types we used were binary, sql, and text.  I look forward to learning more.

Here are a few of the other concepts we explored today:

- What is the Pandas library?
  - A Pandas library is helps with data manipulation and analysis.  It is interesting because you never really see Pandas.  It is running in the background
- What is a Jupyter Notebook?
  - A Jupyter Notebook is a code editor that has the ability to run commands
- How do you importa the pandas library into a Jupyter notebook?
  - To import the code you have to add panda through its commands.  The comands have .pd at the end.
- How can we add data to a Jupyter notebook?
  - You can upload files on the left side of Google collab and you can edit the file name.
- How can we access the data we add to a Jupyter notebook?
  - YOu can acess the data through adding a line of code
- How can transform our data from it's file type into a dataframe?
  - It is good to use a CSV file for a dataframe.
- What is a dataframe?
- What are a few examples of different file types?
  - SQL, Text,
