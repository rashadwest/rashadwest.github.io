#Howard University Speaking Opportunity 

I had a pleasure talking at Howard University. It was an amazing experience. The students were asking terrific questions. They were engaged throughout 
the whole talk. I focused on 3 core areas within the talk. 

1. Basketball Analytics 
2. XR (Virtual Reality & Augumented Reality) Projects 
3. Careers in Emerging Technology 

It was great to see the interest of the youth who loved what we were doing. I thoroghly enjoyed it. I have now talked at Shaw, Saint Augustine, Howard, NC A&T, NCCU, and Hampton. 
By the end of October I will have spoken at JCSU and Morehouse as well. 

Dr. Perry is doing a great job introducing his students to nuanced technology within the sports sector.
