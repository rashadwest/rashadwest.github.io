# Analytics Culuture
Here is an advanced analytic where we have developed an advanced analytic called the Beat The Expert (BTE) box score.  The box score uses our court plotting system to determine where you are on the court when you shoot the ball. 
The plotting system enables an individual to determine location by color.  This color pattern gives fans, general managers, data scientists, statisticians, and analysts a way of knowing where a player is without needing a shot plot.  

Each square represents a color from the color grid.  It teaches individual colors and where the colors are on the color wheel.  It also lets the player know where they are on the court at any time.  Within the box score, there are boxes.  Each box represents a score.  The key is below.  Let me know if you can predict your favorite player's primary color if we were to do a career chart on him or her.  You can send me an email to rashad@beattheexpert.com. 

Lastly, this analytic is educational.  The unique analytic is teaching individuals the color wheel.  We are a S.T.E.A.M (Science, Technology, Enginerring, Art, and Mathmatics) platform.
